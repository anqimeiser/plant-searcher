# plant-searcher
I'm creating this project to familiarize myself further with full stack development. Used Tech With Tim's project https://github.com/techwithtim/Learn-React-In-One-Project to help me get started. Adapted code to my own interests -- a plant API. The goal is to add a backend so users can save their information.
